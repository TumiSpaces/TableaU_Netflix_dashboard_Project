Analysis of Total Movies and TV Shows by Years:
Netflix needs to constantly monitor the content they offer to their subscribers. By analyzing the total number of movies and TV shows added to their platform over the years, they can identify trends and patterns. create a line graph that shows the number of movies and TV shows added each year. You can also add filters to see the distribution of content by country, genre, and ratings.

Total Movies & TV Shows by Country:
Netflix offers content from various countries, and they need to ensure that they have a good mix of content from different regions. Using Tableau, create a map that shows the number of movies and TV shows by country, also use filters to see the distribution of content by genre, rating, and release year.

Top 10 Genres:
Netflix needs to know which genres are popular among their subscribers. By analyzing the data on the top 10 genres, they can focus on acquiring more content in those areas. Using Tableau, create a bar chart that shows the number of movies and TV shows by genre, also add filters to see the distribution of content by country, rating, and release year.

Movies & TV Shows Distributions:

Netflix needs to ensure that the content they offer meets the expectations of their subscribers. By analyzing the ratings, description, date added, duration, rating, release year, and genre, they can make informed decisions about the content they acquire. Using Tableau, create a dashboard that shows the average rating of movies and TV shows, the description of the top-rated content, the date added, the duration of the content, the rating, release year, and genre. We can also add filters to see the distribution of content by country.
